\arguments{
\item{object}{a \code{
\link[SummarizedExperiment:SummarizedExperiment-class]{SummarizedExperiment}}
object}

\item{x}{character, name of the column to be used as x-axis}

\item{save}{logical, if false, the plots are not saved but returned as a list}

\item{file_path}{character, a file path for PDF or prefix added to the file 
paths for other formats}

\item{format}{character, format in which the plots should be saved}

\item{all_features}{logical, should all features be used? If FALSE
(the default), flagged features are removed before visualization.}

\item{color}{character, name of the column to be used for coloring}

\item{color_scale}{the color scale as returned by a ggplot function. 
Set to NA to choose the appropriate scale based on the class of the coloring 
variable.}

\item{shape}{character, name of the column used for shape}

\item{title, subtitle}{column names from feature data to use as plot 
title/filename and subtitle.
Set to NULL for no title/subtitle, this creates running numbered filenames}

\item{shape_scale}{the shape scale as returned by a ggplot function}

\item{text_base_size}{integer, base size for text in figures}

\item{point_size}{numeric, size of the points}

\item{title_line_length}{integer, maximum length of the title line in 
characters, passed to \code{\link[stringr]{str_wrap}}}

\item{theme}{a ggplot theme to be added to the plot}

\item{assay.type}{character, assay to be used in case of multiple assays}

\item{...}{other arguments to graphic device functions, like width and height}
}
\value{
By default, the function is invoked for its plot-saving side effect. 
The function returns a list of plots when \code{save = FALSE}.
}
\description{
Draws a scatterplots with a feature on y-axis and another variable on x-axis.
A separate plot is drawn and saved for each feature.
